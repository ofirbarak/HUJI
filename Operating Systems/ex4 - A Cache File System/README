DESCRIPTION:
We've constructed the cache with list of blocks. Every block contains
information about the file - actual size of the block, the date, id..
FBR algorithm implemented by creating a list of blocks and two indexes
 representing the indices of old part, middle part, and the new part.
The first list of blocks and the fbr_blocks_list are lise stack -
 every time we add new block, if it already in the list, delete it and add
 it to the end of the list.
  When we need to delete a block, if it LRU or LRU algorithms it easy,
  for FBR algorithm we look at the old part (look at fbr_blocks_list, in the old
  part, from thee begining to EndOldPart variable, and take the one according
  to LRU).
When we want to read, first we try to find it in the cache, if not all the
blocks there so we need to read the from the disk and save them on the cache.

REMARKS:
None.
