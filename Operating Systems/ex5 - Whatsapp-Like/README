ANSWERS:
    Q.1: a. Add in 'handleSTDInput' if the command is 'leave_group',
            create one more function that checks the syntax of that
            command - structure, name. If passed, send the all command
            to 'send' function.
         b. In 'handleClientRequest' function add oen more if that checks
            if the command is 'leave_group', send it to another function 
            that takes care that kind of commands. In the function, needs
            to be checked that the group name exists and the client is
            member of that group, if failed, send an error message to the 
            sender, if succeed, (maybe send other group members that 'x'
            has left), check if there are left members in the group, if not,
            delete the group from 'groups'.

    Q.2: TCP is more safer and we want that the messages that we send surely
         will arrive their destination, moreover the order of arrived messages
         is important.
    
    Q.3: 1. Games - the speed is critical, and sometimes we don't care that all
            the data will pass. 
         2. Aircraft controls and flight instruments - again the speed is 
            critical.

    Q.4: To avoid that, we need to store the data on the users evry period.
         For example, write all the currently users and groups are connected, 
         every 5 seconeds. Note that we will loss some data but not all of it.
