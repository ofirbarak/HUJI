We have 'Point' class that represents a point (contains x and y coordinates).
The 'PointSet' class has an array of pointers to points (that already created).
When we add points i check if there is a place, if not double the array and copy all points
to the new array and add the point to the first place is possible.
When delete a point i find the index that point placed and then delete it and move the last
point to that place such that all the points are continuity in the array.

So, in the beginning i insert all points to the array.
After that run the algorithm (counter-clockwise) - _find the lowest rightmost point, then sort
all the array by polar angel. Then begin at the minimal point - take the next two point in
the sorted array, if we turn left we don't count this point - so swap it with the next point.
In that way we run until the last point (and that why i increased the array by 1 -  to place
the minimal point again, because every time we check if we go right or left we need 3 points.
