1.
There is a difference between serial and parallel computation. Parallel computation is
much more faster, this because use of threads that helps us to run calculation for each
row simultaneously. And use of optimisation.

2.
There is difference between +/- to *, because computing operator '+' between 2 matrix
requires less calculations that multiplicity.
