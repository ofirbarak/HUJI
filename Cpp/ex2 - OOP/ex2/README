The basic unit is Point that represents by 2 coordinates - x and y. Than line represents 2 points.
A shape consists of collection of lines and have a name - that's the 'Shape' abstract class.
 It has 2 derived classes - the shapes that defined in the exercise - Triangle and Trapezoid.

I have created the 'Line' class because shapes are consists of lines that connected together and
not just points, Moreover it easier to pass on lines than points because the determinant checks
require lines therefor each iteration we need to add the last point or do other trick.
'Shape' class is abstract because we cannot just create a shape, we creates objects, but all
shapes have collection of lines and a name. Moreover, it contains interfaces, like printShape and
 area that all shapes have - this is why they declared in 'Shape' class as pure virtual function
 (use the polymorfizm).
 'Shapes' class contains validates function for shapes and they not placed in constructors
 because construct an object costs an expansive time.
