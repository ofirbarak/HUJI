=  Special Comments  =
======================
The changes between python 2.* and 3.* :    1. Python 3.* have better Unicode support
2. Several aspects of the core language have been adjusted to be easier for newcomers to learn

-I used the website: https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3
-In math_print.py, task_6() could be done in loop:
	for side in range(1,11):
	    print(side**2)
