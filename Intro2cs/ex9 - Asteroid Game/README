-I discussed with Netanel Faummy
-I used the website: https://docs.python.org/3/
    and http://stackoverflow.com/
- 3 decision we had:
1. Whether too implement random values for position and velocity in general
    class or call for a random value every time we had
    -The pro of the alternative way is less complicate for building
    -We chose the build function, to write no repetitive code
2. Whether to take out small function from loop game - like move_object or
    is_game_should_end
    -Pro of alternative way: Less work
    We chose to split the code because it's simplify the code, make it
        more readable
3. Whether to implement creating of an torpedo in ship class or in
    asteroids_main.py
    -Pro of alternative way: More logical to do it in mains_asteroids_main
    We chose to do it from ship class because in that way we again simplify
        the code because we don't need to pass arguments to main and from
        main to torpedo__init__ just directly to torpedo__init__
