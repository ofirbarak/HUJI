My algorithm for the smart player:
1. Areas = number of areas on board. (Area = a sequence of 'I' without 'O' in the middle)
2. If i the second player (the opposite for the first):
    a. If there is an area in size > 1
        Check if areas is a odd number.
        If yes, find a move in size > 1 and choose part of it that after the move still areas will be odd.
        Otherwise, find a move in size > 1 and choose all, that after the move areas will be odd.
    b. Otherwise, all areas are in size = 1
        choose some area
