3.1:
    _MyLinkedList is not a public struct (other functions are not using _MyLinkedList struct
    and that why we prefer to define it in .c file.
    Moreover when we include the header in some files and than linkage them it will cause
    an error because we redefinition this struct.

3.2:
    The header file just tells the compiler what types external (functions, macros)
    the compiler adds each using from header file an "unresolved" symbol in the object file,
    and then the linker will try to find that.
